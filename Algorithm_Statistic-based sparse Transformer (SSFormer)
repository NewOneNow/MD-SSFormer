Algorithm 1 Statistic-based sparse Transformer (SSFormer)
Input: Feature map X  RH×W×C, Split factor S, and patch size rate P.
Initialization: The Sets of patches Sets = {}; Layer number L; Max iteration time T; Iteration index t = 0.
1:	While t < T do
Stage1:	Adaptive split and patches grouping
2:	for i in P do
3:	Compute patch sizes Ni = (S * 2i) / 2L-1
4:	Split feature X to patch sets Patchesi = {p1, p2, …, pk}
5:	Add Patchesi into Sets
6:	end for
Stage2:	Statistic-based patch discriminator and feature aggregation
7:	for Patchesi in Sets do
8:	for patch in patchesi do
9:	Perform F-test (p, X) using (8)

10:	Return statistical result SR
11:	if SR do
12:	Update p  att(patch) using (7)

13:	end for
14:	Aggregate patchesi to Xi
15:	end for
16:	t++
17:	end while
Output refined feature map X’
