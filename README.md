We propose a high-efficiency method for medical image segmentation. It consists of three key modules: Dual branch encoder(DBEncoder), Statistic-based sparse Transformer(SSFormer), and the morphological difference catcher(MDC). To evaluate the effsectiveness of our proposed modules, we conduct numrous experiments on four datasets, ISIC2017, Kvasir, BUSI, and 3DIRCADb datasets.
The overview of the MD-SSFormer.

If you want to realize the MD-SSFormer, please read it!
Firstly, learning statistical analysis.
Secondly, learning morphological knowledge.
Thridly, Try one more time.
